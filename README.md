# Hi, I'm Camilo!
## Interests
I have been heavily inspired by Casey Muratori and Jon Blow to write my own code and understand at a deeper level, what is happening with my computer.
I'm interested in game development first and foremost, I have a lot of of experience with Unity but want to start writing my own game engine.
Aside from that I find systems really interesting, and enjoy writing system code.
